## About The Project
<p>Our team wants to create a more modern Cash Register, where our project will have several advantages such as a fast and accurate calculation process for many products at once, cheaper because there is no need to buy some hardware such as sensors and personal computers, and of course our products will be more efficient for operational costs because they do not require too much electrical energy to operate it. <br><br>

</p>

## App Overview
Smail is a user-friendly mobile application that aims to revolutionize the traditional cash register system. Built with the latest technology, Smail streamlines the buying and selling process, providing UMKM owners with an efficient and reliable solution.
<br>
